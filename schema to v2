For the v2 of the app, the following changes will be made to the schema:

Users will be able to create multiple playlists instead of just one.
Users will have multiple account types, each with different privileges (e.g. "free", "standard", and "premium").
To migrate the schema for v2, the following steps can be taken:

Add a new table User_Playlist with columns user_id and playlist_id to represent the many-to-many relationship between User and Playlist.
Modify the User table to add a new column account_type_id to store the account type of the user.
Update the queries and stored procedures that access or modify the affected tables to account for the new schema.
Specifically, for the first step, the User_Playlist table will have two foreign keys to the User and Playlist tables respectively.
This will allow multiple playlists to be associated with a user, and for a playlist to be associated with multiple users.

For the second step, the User table will have a foreign key to the Account_Type table. 
This will allow the account type of the user to be easily queried and updated.

In terms of data migration, the existing data for users, playlists, and songs will need to be updated to account for the new schema.
This can be achieved through SQL scripts that update the existing data and populate the new tables as needed.

Overall, the migration process for v2 will involve making structural changes to the database schema and updating the queries and stored
procedures that access or modify the affected tables.
The process will also involve updating the existing data to account for the new schema.
